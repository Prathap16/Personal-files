Managing Partitions and file system:

1 Parition: A continous set of blocks on hard drive that treated as independent drives.

Why Partitioning:

*...Encapsulate your data.

*...Increace disk space efficiency.

*...Limit the data growth.

+++++++File system++++++++
The method of storing data in an organised fation on drive.

Type of file systems:
ExT2
ExT3
ExT4

+++Mounting+++++++
the process of attacinf directory to the portition aand file system.

Files which is related to mounting.

/etc/mtab >>>current mounting points
/etc/fstab .>>>>>>permanent mount points.

Lab work:+++++++++++++++

1. To view the existing portition.

	#fdisk -l or parted -l

2. Partition Administration.

	#fdisk device name
	#fdisk /dev/sdb

		*m---to print the options (or) for help
		*p__Print the partition tab le.
		*n---Create new  partion.
		* l__list the know partition types.

		*t--Change partion system id
		*w--to write table and quite
		*q--quite without saving.
		*d--to delete the partition.

3. Updating partion table without restart.

	#partprobe /dev/sdb or #partx -a /dev/sdb

4. Formating the file system.

	#mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdb1
	#mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb2
5. Mounting:.

	1 Temporary
	2 Permanent
....1 Temaprary mounting.
	#mount /dev/sdb1 /ktdir
	#mount devicename mount poit directory
.......to view all mount points
	#mount
.......to unmount 
	#umount mountpoint directorypath
	#umount /ktdir	

......2 Permanent mounting

.....Make an entry in /etc/fstab
	#vi /etc/fstab

Device name	mountpoint	typerof fs		mountingoption	dumping checksequemce
/dev/sdb1	/root/ktdir	ext4		defaults		0 0

........update the entry in fstab and mount all entries in fstab
	#mount -a
......if you umount you will get some errors.
	1.your are in same directory and trying to unmount.
	2.some users are present using content in that directry.
		#fuser -cu /dev/sdb2
	check for fles which are open.
		#lsof /dev/sdb2
Unmounting is like removing entry in fstab.


Disk free command:
	#df option filename
		1.h human readable
		2.T type of filesystem
***Assigning lable to partition:
	#e2lable devicename lable name
	#e2lable /dev/sdb1 ravi

Swap+
________________________________________
Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and 
the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. 
While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM.

Commands to be used in maintaining Swap spaces
? To see the memory size and the swap space size
#free –m
? To see the swap usage use
#swapon –s
? To format the partition with swap file system use
#mkswap <parititon name>
? To activate the swap space use
#swapon <partition name>
? To deactivate the swap space use
#swapoff <partition name>
