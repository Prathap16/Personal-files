SELinux:---------
______________________________________________-

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides 
a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including mandatory access controls (MAC). 
SELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions.

Important SELinux configuration Files
/etc/selinux/config is the main configuration file of SELinux.
/etc/sysconfig/selinux contains a symbolic link to the actual configuration file, /etc/selinux/config.

Modes of SELinux
? There are three modes in which SELinux can be at a time, they are
? Enforcing, Permissive and Disabled
? Enforcing
Enable and enforce the SELinux security policy on the system, denying access and logging actions
? Permissive
Permissive mode is similar to Debugging Mode. In Permissive Mode, SELinux policies and rules are applied to subjects and objects, but actions ( for example, Access Control denials) are not affected. 
The biggest advantage of Permissive Mode is that log files and error messages are generated based on the SELinux policy implemented.
? Disabled
SELinux is turned off and no warn and log messages will be generated and stored


To check the SELinux Mode
#getenforce
#sestatus

Display the SELinux context of a file or directory.
To display the context of a file the syntax is
#ls –Z <filename>

To display the context of a directory the syntax is
#ls –ldZ <directory name>

Displaying the SELinux Context of a Process
To display the context of a process running in the system, the syntax is
#ps –efZ |grep <process name>
#ps –efZ |grep http

Changing the Modes of SElinux
To change the mode of SElinux the syntax is
#setenforce <option>
Options used are 0 or 1 (Where 0 means Permissive and 1 means Enforcing)
To change the SELinux Mode to permissive
#setenforce 0
To change the SELinux Mode back to Enforcing mode
#setenforce 1
? Verify it by getenforce or sestatus command.
