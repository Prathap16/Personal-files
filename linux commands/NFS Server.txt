NFS(NETWORK FILE SYSTEM/SHARING)
? NFS stands for Network File System, and is a way to share files between machines as if they were on your local hard drive. 
Linux can be both an NFS server and an NFS client, which means that it can export filesystems to other systems, 
and mount filesystems exported from other machines.
? For example NFS server could be a Linux system and Unix could be a client. But it can’t be a window system because window is not NFS compatible. 
The NFS server exports one or more directories to the client systems, and the client systems mount one or more of the shared directories 
to local directories called mount points. After the share is mounted, all I/O operations are written back to the server, 
and all clients notice the change as if it occurred on the local filesystem.
? A manual refresh is not needed because the client accesses the remote filesystem as if it were local. 
Because access is granted by IP address, a username and password are not required. 
However, there are security risks to consider because the NFS server knows nothing about the users on the client system.

Steps to configure NFS server:
Step1: Install the NFS package using yum or rpm.
Step2: Create a dir or directory .
Step3: Export the directory by editing /etc/exports file and using exportfs command
Step4: Restart the services and make it permanent.

Step1: Install the NFS package.
? Check whether the package is installed
#rpm –q nfs-utils
? If it is not installed use following command to install it
#yum install nfs-utils* -y

Step2: Create a directory 
#mkdir /root/divya

Step3: Export the directory by editing /etc/exports file and using exportfs command
? Edit the /etc/exports file
#vim /etc/exports
****/root/divya	192.168.43.220/24(rw,rsync)

? Now run the exportfs command to export the directory
#exportfs –avr
Options:
-a Exports or un-exports all directories
-r Reexport all directories
-u Unexports one or more directories
-v Provides verbose outpu

Client side configuration for NFS mounting:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step1: Check and Install the NFS package if not installed
Step2: Start the NFS services
Step3: Check which directory is exported for this machine using showmount command
Step4: Make a directory and mount the NFS dir over it.
Step5: Add some data to it and check the same is updated on server side

Step1: Check and Install the package for NFS
#rpm –q nfs-utils
It is already installed, if it is not installed use yum install nfs-utils* -y

Step2: check and start the NFS services and make it permanent.
#service nfs start
#chkconfig - -list nfs

Step3: Check which directory is exported for this machine using showmount command
? To check the exported directories from server the syntax is
#showmount –e <server ip address>

Step4: Make a directory and mount NFS over it.
? #mkdir /ktnfs
? #mount –t nfs 192.168.10.91:/ktdir /ktnfs

Step5: Add some data to it and check the same is updated on server side.
? Note that it is showing permission error because on server side the directory does not have write permissions neither for group nor for others.
? Log into server and add write permission to NFS directory
? Now , Again move back to client machine and try uploading some files
? To make it permanent mount edit /etc/fstab file as follows

Auto-mounting the NFS directory:
------------------------------------------------------------
? All the resources of the server is valuable and needs to be available for usage, 
when we mount a NFS directory over client the network resource gets busy, 
even when the work is finished the network resource will still be busy as mounting occupy it.
? Autofs automatically mounts file systems for you when they are requested. 
This has a very handy feature: It's great for handling removable media. Just CD to the right directory,
 or execute ls or do anything that sends a request to the mount point: and the daemon mounts it. After all, 
it's the kind of job that's beneath the dignity of a human being First; you need to install the "autofs" package. 
It should include some appropriate config files. The files you need is /etc/auto. Master

Steps to configure auto mount at client side

Step1: Log into client side and check whether autofs is install or not, if not install autofs
? Check whether autofs is install or not
#rpm –q autofs
? if it is not installed, install it by using yum or rpm
#yum install autofs* -y

Step2: Edit the /etc/auto. master as follows
#vim /etc/auto.master Standby time
Dir to mount NFS auto mount configuration file for this mount point

Step3: Create /etc/auto.ktnfs file and /ktnfs directory if not created earlier
? #vim /etc/auto.ktnfs

Steps for removing NFS:
___________________________

Step1: Remove all autofs details from all config files like /etc/auto.master and /etc/auto.ktnfs.

Step2: un-export all the directory which was exported earlier using following command
? # exportfs –auv
