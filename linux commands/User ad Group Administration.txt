USER ADMINISTRATION:-----
_____________________________________________________

Some Important Points related to Users:
? Users and groups are used to control access to files and resources
? Users login to the system by supplying their username and password
? Every file on the system is owned by a user and associated with a group
? Every process has an owner and group affiliation, and can only access the resources its owner or group can access.
? Every user of the system is assigned a unique user ID number ( the UID)
? Users name and UID are stored in /etc/passwd
? User’s password is stored in /etc/shadow in encrypted form.
? Users are assigned a home directory and a program that is run when they login (Usually a shell)
? Users cannot read, write or execute each other’s files without permission.


Users name and UID are stored in /etc/passwd
User’s password is stored in /etc/shadow in encrypted form.

The /etc/passwd file:::::::::7
This file contains a list of all user accounts. Each user account is stored in an individual line. Each line contains following seven fields separated by colons.

Username
Placeholder character for password
UID
GID
Description
Home directory
Login shell

The /etc/shadow file:;;;;9
This file stores users’ password and password related information. Just like /etc/passwd file, this file also uses an individual line for each entry. Each line contains following nine fields.

Username
Encrypted password
Number of days when password was last changed
Number of days before password can be changed
Number of days after password must be changed
Number of days before password expiry date to display the warning message
Number of days to disable the account after the password expiry
Number of days since the account is disabled
Reserved field

Password Complexity Requirements:
? A root user can change password of self and of any user in the system, there are no rules for root to assign a password. Root can assign any length of password either long or short, it can be alphabet or numeric or both. On the whole there is no limitation for root for assigning a password.
? A normal user can change only its password. Valid password for a normal user should adhere to the following rules
? It should be at least 7 characters but not more than 255 characters.
? At least one character should be Upper case
? At least one character should be Lower case
? At least one character should be a symbol, and one character should be a number.
? It should not match the previous password.
? It cannot have a sequence (ex: 123456 or abcdef )
? The login name and the password cannot be same.

Creating a user:::::
? The syntax for creating a user in Linux is
? # useradd <option> <username>
? options are
? -u user id
? -G Secondary group id
? -g primary group id
? -d home directory
? -c comment
? -s shell

Let’s create a user with default attributes.
#useradd <username>
#useradd ktusr

Let’s create a user with our own attributes
Create a user with following attributes
? Name = ktuser2
? uid=505
? home dir = /home/kernel
? comment =salesman
? #useradd ktuser2 –u 505 -g 505 –d /home/kernel –c salesman

Assigning password to the user:::
As a root user we can assign any password to any user
? The syntax for assigning a password is
? #passwd to assign password to current user ( the one with which you have logged in, if it is root then root’s password will be changed)
? #passwd <user name> to assign a password to a specific user, only root can assign password to other user.

Modifying the user’s attribute
? After creating a user if we need to modify the attributes of user like changing uid, changing secondary group id or adding a comment, locking or unlocking the user account, can be done by following command
# usermod <options> <username>
? options are:
? all the options which are used with useradd command can be used and also the following,
? -l to change login name
? -L to LOCK account
? -U to UNLOCK account
? ex. # usermod -l newname oldname (changing the name of the user)
? ex. # usermod -L newname to lock the user account
? ex. # usermod -U newname to unlock the user account
? Note: - when an account is locked it will show! (Exclamation mark) in /etc/shadow file.


#chage <option> <value> <username>
? The options which can be used are as follows
? -m for Min password age
? -M for Max password age
? -d for last time the password is changed.
? -W Password expiration warnings
? -I Password inactive [-1 means inactive].
? -E A/C expiration date

Deleting a User:
? To delete a user the syntax used is
? #userdel <username> it will only delete the user but home directory will be there. To delete the user with its home directory use the following command.
? #userdel –r < user name >
? #userdel –r ktuser2

 #groupadd ktgroup


#groupadd <option> <name for the group>
#groupadd -g 595 ktgroup

Modifying the properties of the group
? To modify the group properties the syntax is
? #groupmod <option> <arguments> <group name>
? The options are

**To add single user to the group
#usermod –G <group name > < user name>
#usermod –G ktgroup ktuser

Adding multiple single or multiple users to the group with various attributes
