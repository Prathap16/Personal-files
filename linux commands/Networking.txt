Networking:

Some Important configuration files/directories of network configurations:

#/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts 
is the directory which keeps the configuration of network devices connected to the system.

#/etc/sysconfig/network 
is a file which keeps the information about the hostname assigned to the system. 
If you want to change the hostname permanently, you need to change the hostname in this file.

#/ete/hostname same as above in centos7

#/etc/hosts 
a file which is responsible for resolving hostname into IP locally, in other word it acts as local DNS if DNS server is not accessible.

#/etc/resolv.conf 
is a file which keeps the address of DNS server to which the clients will be accessing to resolve IP to hostname and hostname to IP.
