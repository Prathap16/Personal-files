BACKUP AND RESTORE
? In information technology, a backup or the process of backing up is making copies of data which may be used to restore the original after a data loss
 event.
? Backups have two distinct purposes
? The primary purpose is to recover data after its loss, be it by data deletion or corruption. 
Data loss is a very common experience of computer users. 67% of Internet users have suffered serious data loss.
? The secondary purpose of backups is to recover data from an earlier time, 
according to a user-defined data retention policy, typically configured within a backup application for how long copies of data are required.
? Backup is the most important job of a system administrator, as a system admin it is your duty to take backup of the data every day.
? Many companies have gone out of the market because of poor backup planning.
? The easiest way to back up your files is just copying. But if you have too many files to backup, 
copying and restoring may take too long time and it is not convenient. If there is a tool that can put many files into one file, the world will be better. 
Fortunately, 'tar' is used to create archive files. It can pack files or directories into a 'tar' file. It is like WinZip in Windows, without much compression.
? The gzip program compresses a single file. One important thing to remember about gzip is that, unlike tar, 
it replaces your original file with a compressed version. (The amount of compression varies with the type of data, 
but a typical text file will be reduced by 70 to 80 percent.)

LAB WORK:-
To backup the file using tar
? To backup the file using tar the syntax is
#tar –cvf <destination and name to be > < source file>
#tar –cvf /opt/etc.tar /etc
? Check the size of tar file by using du –h <file name > command
#du –h /opt/etc.tar
Apply gzip on tar file and check the size.
? To apply gzip on a tar file, the syntax is
#gzip <file name>
#gzip /opt/etc.tar
? Now check the size of the file

Transfer the file to other system and remove gzip and tar from it and check the size on every step.
? Let’s transfer the file to other computer using scp
#scp /opt/etc.tar.gz 192.168.10.95:/root/
? Login to the remote system, remove gzip it and check the size.
? To gunzip a file the syntax is
#gunzip <file name>
#gunzip etc.tar.gz
Untar the file and check for the size of the file/directory
? To untar a file the syntax is
#tar -xvf <file name>
#tar –xvf etc.tar

c – Creates a new .tar archive file.
v – Verbosely show the .tar file progress.
f – File name type of the archive file.


Create tar.gz Archive File
tar -cvzf MyImages-14-09-12.tar.gz /home/MyImages

Create tar.bz2 Archive File
The bz2 feature compress and create archive file less than the size of the gzip.
 The bz2 compression takes more time to compress and decompress files as compared to gzip which takes less time. 
To create highly compressed tar file we use option as j.

tar -cvfj Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 /home/php

Uncompress tar.gz Archive File
